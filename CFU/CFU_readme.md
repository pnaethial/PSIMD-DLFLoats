# CFU -The InFamous Custom Function Unit
### Accelerates ML models on FPGAs
“CFU” stands for Custom Function Unit: accelerator hardware that is tightly coupled into the pipeline of a CPU core, to add new custom function instructions that complement the CPU’s standard functions (such as arithmetic/logic operations).
The CFU Playground is a collection of software, gateware and hardware configured to make it easy to:
- Run ML models
- Benchmark and profile performance
- Make incremental improvements
- In software by modifying source code
- In gateware with a CFU
- Measure the results of changes
